# Chatting Basics
Once you've created or selected a character to chat with, click on their character card to begin a conversation with them.

## Greeting Message
Every character initiates a conversation with their greeting message. If the creator of the character has set alternate greetings, you will see a ">" arrow next to the message. Clicking on this arrow allows you to cycle through alternate greetings.

## Responding to a message
In order to respond to a message, type a message in the chatbox and press "Enter" or click "Send". The character will read and respond to your message automatically.

### Message Functions
Charhub provides several functions which enable you to change the responses of characters if you do not like them or simply wish to see another one.

* Regenerate - This regenerates the character's message automatically.
* Edit - This allows you to make changes to a message by hand.
* Delete - This deletes the character's message.

## Personas
By default, the characters view you as your public username. If you'd like your characters to call you by a different name, you can use the Persona feature.

### Creating a persona
1. Sign in to your account
2. Navigate to https://charhub.ai/personas
3. Click on "+ New Persona"
4. Set a name for your Persona, this is the name that your characters will view you as.
5. (Optional) Think of a short description for your persona.
6. Use slider to set "Set as active persona" to true.
7. Characters will utilize your active persona when interacting with you.

## Continuing the conversation
Send "/continue" (without quotation marks) in order to prompt the character to send another response.

## Public Chats
You may optionally share a conversation you had by clicking on the 3 dots next to the conversation name and clicking "Make Public".

Warning: Anyone with the link to the chat will be able to view the chat once it is public!

To set a public chat back to private, within the same conversation, click on the 3 dots again and click "Make Private".
