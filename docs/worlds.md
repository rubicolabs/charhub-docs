# Worlds
## What are worlds?
Because of limitations on [context length](link to context length def), it might not be possible to fit extensive background information or unique details about the world the character lives in. World’s is CharHub’s solution to this problem. It effectively allows you to include a near infinite amount of detail and will automatically include relevant information into the AI’s context so that it can be referenced by the character.

## What to use worlds for?
Worlds are useful for including minute details that might be too verbose to put into the character description. These can include: names and descriptions of places, historical events, important people and their descriptions, past events that have happened to the character, any sort of list, or really any sort of information that might not be relevant to every response.

## How to format worlds
Worlds can be written without any special formatting. It is recommended to write in complete sentences and put a new line after each sentence. Short, bite sized chunks of information tends to work best.
