# Character Creation

## Tokens
Tokens are the building blocks of AI language models. When you talk to the character, it takes each word and breaks it up into tokens. For English, each token is about 3 letters. All messages to and from the AI is counted as tokens.

## Context
Context is an AI’s short term memory, when you talk to a character, it reads your words and tries to understand them, but can only remember a certain amount of tokens before it starts to forget. This is the “context length”.  Longer context lengths allow the character to remember more of what you said which helps it understand and respond better over a longer conversation.

### Replacement tags
Replacement tags are special tags that get replaced before being sent to the AI. 
| Tag         | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| {{char}}    | This will get replaced by the character's name.      |
| {{user}}    | This will be replaced by the user's name.            |
